# Downloader
Brief description:
A python script that downloads files from internet with the ability to detect the extension.

The extension detect feature only works with popular extensiosn and user interaction may be required in many occasions  



 P.S: this project is made with the intention of just doing the job which is why it's not optimized nor documented probably.
